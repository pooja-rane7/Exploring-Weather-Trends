# Exploring-Weather-Trends
This project was completed as part of the course requirements of Udacity's [Data Analyst Nanodegree certification](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002)

### Overview: ###
I have been provided the temperature database from where I have extracted the data related to global temperature and my city temperature (Baltimore). I analyzed the temperature around the global with the city I live by extracting the data from thedatabase.

### Goals: ###
1. Selecting city and country from the database “ city_list ”.
2. Extracting the City level data from the database “ city_data ” and export to CSV file.
3. Extracting the global temperature from the database “ global_data ” and export to CSV file.

### Technologies Used: ###
* SQL
* MS Excel

### Key Findings: ###
1. Global Average Temperature for 10year MA varies between 7.5°C and 8.5°C
2. Baltimore city Average Temperature varies between 10.4°C and 13.4°C
3. The differences in the temperature between the two are not very significant. As observed, Baltimore city has slightly higher temperature compared to the global average temperature.
4. From the above graph, we notice a dip in curve for Baltimore city during 1767 and 1785 as the temperature decreased. In the last few 100 years, the global and city temperatures have been rising due to climatic changes.
5. The change of the climate between the Baltimore city and globe is slightly small, and both of them are rising.

### Conclusion: ###
The final conclusion of this project is, Baltimore is slightly hotter than the globatemperature and the global temperatures are rising over the years which supports the case of “Climate change”.
